# DOX framework

- DOX is highly performant AGENTS.md hierarchy installed here
- Agent must follow DOX instructions across any edits

## Core Contract

- AGENTS.md files are binding work contracts for their subtrees
- Work products, source materials, instructions, records, assets, and durable docs must stay understandable from the nearest applicable AGENTS.md plus every parent AGENTS.md above it

## Read Before Editing

1. Read the root AGENTS.md
2. Identify every file or folder you expect to touch
3. Walk from the repository root to each target path
4. Read every AGENTS.md found along each route
5. If a parent AGENTS.md lists a child AGENTS.md whose scope contains the path, read that child and continue from there
6. Use the nearest AGENTS.md as the local contract and parent docs for repo-wide rules
7. If docs conflict, the closer doc controls local work details, but no child doc may weaken DOX

Do not rely on memory. Re-read the applicable DOX chain in the current session before editing.

## Update After Editing

Every meaningful change requires a DOX pass before the task is done.

Update the closest owning AGENTS.md when a change affects:

- purpose, scope, ownership, or responsibilities
- durable structure, contracts, workflows, or operating rules
- required inputs, outputs, permissions, constraints, side effects, or artifacts
- user preferences about behavior, communication, process, organization, or quality
- AGENTS.md creation, deletion, move, rename, or index contents

Update parent docs when parent-level structure, ownership, workflow, or child index changes. Update child docs when parent changes alter local rules. Remove stale or contradictory text immediately. Small edits that do not change behavior or contracts may leave docs unchanged, but the DOX pass still must happen.

## Hierarchy

- Root AGENTS.md is the DOX rail: project-wide instructions, global preferences, durable workflow rules, and the top-level Child DOX Index
- Child AGENTS.md files own domain-specific instructions and their own Child DOX Index
- Each parent explains what its direct children cover and what stays owned by the parent
- The closer a doc is to the work, the more specific and practical it must be

## Child Doc Shape

- Create a child AGENTS.md when a folder becomes a durable boundary with its own purpose, rules, responsibilities, workflow, materials, or quality standards
- Work Guidance must reflect the current standards of the project or user instructions; if there are no specific standards or instructions yet, leave it empty
- Verification must reflect an existing check; if no verification framework exists yet, leave it empty and update it when one exists

Default section order:
- Purpose
- Ownership
- Local Contracts
- Work Guidance
- Verification
- Child DOX Index

## Style

- Keep docs concise, current, and operational
- Document stable contracts, not diary entries
- Put broad rules in parent docs and concrete details in child docs
- Prefer direct bullets with explicit names
- Do not duplicate rules across many files unless each scope needs a local version
- Delete stale notes instead of explaining history
- Trim obvious statements, repeated rules, misplaced detail, and warnings for risks that no longer exist

## Closeout

1. Re-check changed paths against the DOX chain
2. Update nearest owning docs and any affected parents or children
3. Refresh every affected Child DOX Index
4. Remove stale or contradictory text
5. Run existing verification when relevant
6. Report any docs intentionally left unchanged and why

## User Preferences

When the user requests a durable behavior change, record it here or in the relevant child AGENTS.md.

Project-wide durable preferences (style, workflow, conventions) live in user memory; this section is reserved for contract-level rules that bind every child doc.

## Architectural decisions

- **Agent harness protected by tirith.sh.** Reading passwords or access tokens is prohibited. Extract variables from `.env` / config files without relaying their values; use environment variables by importing them for Bash execution. `***` in output is a tirith redaction marker, not a literal value — never "fix" it to a variable ref.
- **Local MCP broker scope.** Irigate validates loopback-only sharing of explicitly approved stdio MCP upstreams. It is not an enterprise governance, compliance, multi-tenant, or general model-API gateway.
- **Local HTTP origin enforcement.** Streamable HTTP requests must reject malformed and non-loopback `Origin` headers to prevent DNS rebinding. The no-Origin behavior for non-browser local clients must be explicit and proven by the transport spike.
- **No request-delivered credentials.** Credentials must never be accepted through URLs, query parameters, command arguments, logs, or committed profiles. Runtime configuration may reference broker-process environment variables without exposing their values.
- **Optional agent selection.** A bare downstream MCP URL exposes all configured upstreams. Explicit tool or upstream selectors narrow that set; reverse-only selection intentionally follows future profile additions and is not least privilege.

## Session-start tooling

- Use `code-review-graph` MCP tools for structural queries (callers, blast radius, code review) before scanning files. See the `code-review-graph` skill for tool selection and pitfalls. Projects that opt in register their repo in `~/.code-review-graph/registry.json`; pass the registered `repo_root` on tool calls.

## Child DOX Index

- `assets/AGENTS.md` — Reproducible project brand assets and Iris-gate design contract.
- `profiles/AGENTS.md` — Validated static runtime and benchmark profiles.
- `scripts/AGENTS.md` — Repeatable production compatibility and benchmark evidence harnesses.
- `spikes/AGENTS.md` — Disposable transport, sharing, failure, and client-compatibility evidence.
- `src/AGENTS.md` — Production package source and module contracts.
- `tests/AGENTS.md` — Executable behavioral and process-lifecycle contracts.

Root-owned artifacts:

- `README.md` — Current product boundary, MVP summary, and project status.
- `IMPLEMENTATION.md` — Current runtime architecture, implementation contracts, extension workflows, and verification.
- `MARKET-RESEARCH.md` — Market hypothesis, competitive positioning, evidence requirements, and go/no-go criteria.
